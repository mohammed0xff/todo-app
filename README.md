# Todo App
Just another todo project? Why not!

## Satisfying task requirements
In branch [task-accomplished](https://github.com/mohammed0xff/todo-app/tree/task-accomplished) We have a backend api with two endpoints and a frontend app that displays some task entities being retrived from endpoint one GET `api/tasks` and be marked as checked with the help of endpoint two PUT `api/tasks/toggle-checked/{id}`.

And at this point we have our appliction functioning well but not in a way that the end user expects. We want to make this more useful, in order to do so we're going to add some features.

## What features do we need?

Obviously, this is not the first task list or todo list app in the world <br/>
The top two task management apps we all use and love are :
1. Notion 
2. Google Keep

lets clone some features from them!

Most of the features i have in mind rn are focused on the frontend side. Since i've just started learning Angular, this is a great playground to dive deeper in topic.

Here are some features that would definitely take our app to the next level! 

- [ ] having data persestence.
- [ ] adding and removing tasks from the list.
- [ ] changing the ordering of our tasks by dragging them up or down the list. 
- [ ] having multiple lists each of with a title that discripes the kind of tasks that it's going to hold.
- [ ] task hierarchy, tasks can have child tasks. 

Of course you might consider implementing user authentication, allowing multiple users to log in and have their own lists, etc. However, at this point i'm just focusing on the frontend side with aNgUlAr!
